# Project Summary

In this project, we'll complete the functionality of a social media platform by using `axios` in a `react` project. Majority of the application has already been built out for you. Take some time before starting to familarize yourself with the component structure. The platform we'll be building out is a scaled down version of twitter and we'll focus on the functionality for fetching all the DevMountain posts, creating new posts, editing existing posts, and deleting existing posts.

This is a live API, please be respectful and mindful of what you post.
